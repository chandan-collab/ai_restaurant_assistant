🔧 Key Features in Code:
✅ Flask API for handling WhatsApp messages.
✅ Twilio Integration for WhatsApp messaging.
✅ Google Gemini AI (gemini-2.0-flash) for chatbot responses.
✅ SQLite Database for storing orders.
✅ Basic Order Management (placing & confirming orders).




🛠 Module Breakdown

1️⃣ main.py (Entry Point)
Runs the Flask server.
Handles requests and routes them to the correct modules.

2️⃣ core/chatbot.py (Chatbot Logic)
Processes incoming WhatsApp messages.
Calls Google Gemini AI for responses.
Routes messages related to orders to order_manager.py.

3️⃣ core/order_manager.py (Order Processing)
Stores orders in the SQLite database.
Updates order status (confirmed, pending, etc.).
Fetches order history for users.

4️⃣ core/twilio_whatsapp.py (Twilio WhatsApp API)
Sends outgoing messages using Twilio.
Receives incoming messages via Twilio Webhooks.

5️⃣ database/db.py (Database Handling)
Handles database connections.
Runs SQL queries for creating & managing tables.

6️⃣ database/schema.sql (Table Schema)

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user TEXT,
    order_details TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
);

7️⃣ integrations/gemini_ai.py (Google Gemini API Handling)
Sends user messages to Gemini AI.
Formats responses for chatbot use.

📌 What Does menu.py Do?
Stores and retrieves restaurant menu items.
Provides a dynamic menu so it can be updated easily.
When the user types "menu", it responds with the menu and asks them to type:
"order <item_from_menu>" to place an order.


✅ Better Separation of Concerns → Easier maintenance & debugging.
✅ Improved Twilio Handling → Centralized in twilio_whatsapp.py.
✅ Scalable Order Management → order_manager.py handles all order-related logic.
✅ Easier AI Integration → gemini_ai.py manages Gemini API calls separately.
✅ Unit Testing Support → Separate tests/ module for better testing.





 The reason for having gemini_ai.py separately is to keep chatbot logic (chatbot.py) independent of any specific AI model. Here’s the reasoning behind this design choice:

1️⃣ chatbot.py (Handles Conversations & Intent Processing)
Responsible for conversation flow.
Decides whether the message is:
A greeting → ("hi" → responds directly)
A menu request → ("menu" → responds directly)
An order request → ("order paneer" → passes to order_manager.py)
Anything else → Calls gemini_ai.py for AI-generated responses.
✅ Why?

This makes chatbot.py modular and not dependent on a specific AI model.
If you switch from Google Gemini to OpenAI GPT, only gemini_ai.py needs to be updated.

2️⃣ gemini_ai.py (Handles AI Model API Calls)
Contains Google Gemini API calls.
Can be replaced with OpenAI GPT, Rasa, or Dialogflow in the future.
Only responsible for sending user input and receiving AI-generated replies.
✅ Why?

Avoids mixing AI-specific code inside chatbot logic.
Makes it easy to switch to another AI provider.
Keeps chatbot.py focused on conversation structure, not model implementation.







It's good to keep "order", "menu", and "confirm" in main.py rather than chatbot.py. Here's why:

🔹 Why Keep These in main.py?
Separation of Responsibilities

chatbot.py should only handle general chatbot logic (greetings, help, AI-powered responses).
Orders and menu are separate features that belong in order_manager.py and menu.py.
Better Code Organization & Maintainability

If "order" logic was inside chatbot.py, it would mix AI/chat logic with business logic.
Keeping "order" in order_manager.py makes it easier to maintain order-related functions.
"menu" belongs to menu.py, which is designed for managing restaurant menu items.
Easier to Scale

If tomorrow you want to change the menu or improve order processing, you just update menu.py or order_manager.py without touching chatbot.py.
Consistent Message Routing

main.py acts as a router that directs messages based on intent.
This structure keeps chatbot logic separate from business rules (ordering, menu, etc.).
🚀 What Should chatbot.py Handle?
✅ Greetings (hi, hello)
✅ Help messages (need help?)
✅ General AI-powered responses (Google Gemini AI)

🚀 What Should main.py Handle?
✅ Routes messages to the right module (order_manager.py, menu.py, chatbot.py)
✅ Ensures "menu" goes to menu.py and "order" goes to order_manager.py

💡 Final Thought
Moving "order", "menu", and "confirm" into chatbot.py would mix chatbot responses with business logic, which is bad practice. Keeping them in main.py is the best approach!
